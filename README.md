# homebrew-tap

Provides Homebrew formulae for a few programs that aren't availble in the main Homebrew or Pivotal taps. 

To use:

```
$ brew tap seattle-beach/tap
$ brew install gi     # or whatever
```

Note that this is already set up for you if you used [Alfalfa](https://github.com/seattle-beach/alfalfa/).
